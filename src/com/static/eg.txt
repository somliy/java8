There is a famous saying in Chinese proverb that Gold can’t be pure and nobody is perfect.
But only few people realize its essence. Accepting the imperfection is the lesson that everybody should learn.
The things they complain maybe the advantages in other people’s eyes. Shortcoming is part of human nature, so just be nice to it.
